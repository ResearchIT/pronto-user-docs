# Transfer files to pronto with SMB

You will need to be on campus or connected to the VPN.

On Windows, open File Explorer and enter this folder path:
```
\\prontodtn.las.iastate.edu
```

On MacOS, open Finder and enter this into the Connect dialog.

```
smb://prontodtn.las.iastate.edu
```

Note: The ISU VPN has limited bandwidth. If you have a large amount of data to transfer, or you want to transfer files without using the VPN, we recommend that you use [Globus](globus.md).
