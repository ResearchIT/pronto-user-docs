# Request access to Pronto

If you are a new member in a lab that already uses pronto, please ask your advisor/PI to visit our [Self-Service Portal](https://diy.las.iastate.edu/) and add you to their lab list. The site is only accessible from on-campus or through use of the VPN service.

If you are a PI and would like access to any of our resources, please email [researchit@iastate.edu](mailto:researchit@iastate.edu).  Our access is all handled via group membership in a -lab group.  If your netid is jones, then we will create a group called 'jones-lab'. This group will be granted access to a correspondingly named LSS folder, working folder, and will be used for server/cluster access.
