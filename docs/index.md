# Pronto Cluster

Pronto is a compute cluster that uses the [Slurm workload manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html).

It is available through SSH or through your web browser using [Open OnDemand](ondemand/index.md).

Pronto has a mix of [server types](hardware.md) for both single and multi-core jobs. It has several GPU servers with NVIDIA 1080Ti, V100, and A100 cards for molecular dynamics, deep learning, etc. Pronto also has a many-core cluster built on Intel Knights Landing architecture that's great for multi-threaded work like Monte-Carlo simulations.
